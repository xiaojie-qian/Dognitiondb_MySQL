# The project aims to to increase the number of completed tests

1. Personality demension vs total completed tests
There are total 10 different personality dimensions and one Null row. 
After examing, we can exclude Null value. It returns that socialite has completed most tests and vice verse einstein completed the least. 
However, there are not appreciable differences in the number of tests completed by dogs with different Dognition personality dimensions.

2. Breed group vs total completed tests
There are total 8 different breed group and one Null row.
Herding and Sporting breed_groups complete the most tests, while Hound breed groups complete the least tests. 
It is interesting to see if our marketing focus has targeted Herding and Sporting more? 

3. Breed type vs total completed tests
There are 4 breed types.
There does not appear to be an appreciable difference between number of tests completed by dogs of different breed types.
A dog's breed_type doesn't seem to have a strong relationship with how many tests a dog completed
Neutered dogs, on average, seem to finish 1-2 more tests than non-neutered dogs

4. Test duration vs total completed tests

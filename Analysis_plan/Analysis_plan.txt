Var 3: Dognition breed_type -> Assess whether dog breeds and neutering are related to the number of tests completed? - Q14-Q18
Var 4: Exame the relationship between the speed of game completion and number of games completed is best achieved through creating a scatter plot with a best fit line and/or running a statistical regression analysis. 
Var 5: During which weekdays do Dognition users complete the most tests?
